These computations were done in order to estimate the error tracker confronts while detecting pedestrians entering from the boundaries of tracked area.
The ignored portions are towards the west of flux line vectors shown in display.

files having tag A had flux vector at line at x=0
files having tag B had flux vector at line at x=6
files having tag C had flux vector at line at x=-6
